# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🧭 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to understanding **Requirement Analysis**—a critical first step in software development.

Before building any software, it's important to understand **what the users need**, **what problems the software should solve**, and **what features should be included**. This process is known as requirement analysis.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Explain what requirement analysis is in simple terms
- Describe its importance in the development process
- Share techniques and examples used by developers and teams
- Help beginners and professionals communicate clearly with clients and users

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of figuring out exactly what a software product should do **before** any coding begins.

It involves talking to the people who will use the software (like clients, customers, or users), asking questions, and writing down what they need the software to do. These needs are called **requirements**.


### 🧠 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is like drawing a map before starting a journey. If you skip this step, you might build the wrong thing, waste time, or confuse the users.

Here’s why it’s so important in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**:

- ✅ **Clarity:** It helps everyone understand what the software is supposed to do.
- 🛠️ **Better Planning:** Developers can plan the system architecture and features based on clear goals.
- 💬 **Good Communication:** It ensures that clients, designers, and developers are all on the same page.
- 💸 **Saves Time & Money:** Catching mistakes early (before coding) is cheaper and faster than fixing them later.
- 🚀 **Improves Quality:** The final product is more useful, user-friendly, and reliable.


### 📦 Real-Life Example

Imagine someone asks you to build an "online shop" but doesn’t explain what products to sell, how users should pay, or how items are delivered. You might build something completely wrong.

With **requirement analysis**, you would first ask:
- What products will be sold?
- Who are the users?
- How should payment work?
- What happens after someone places an order?

Once you have these answers, you can build exactly what they need—no guessing!


> In short, **requirement analysis helps turn ideas into clear, doable tasks**, making the entire software development process smoother and smarter.

## ❗ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a **crucial role** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Without it, developers might build the wrong product or face major issues during development.

Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is so important:

### 1. ✅ Builds the Right Product

When teams understand the user’s exact needs, they can build a product that actually solves real problems. Without proper analysis, features might be missed—or worse, unnecessary features might be added.

> **Example:** A client wants a student registration system. Without asking questions, the team builds one for teachers instead of students. Time wasted!


### 2. ⏱️ Saves Time and Resources

It’s much cheaper and faster to make changes during the planning stage than during coding or testing. Requirement Analysis helps identify issues early—before the project moves too far.

> **Think of it like:** Fixing the blueprint of a house before the construction begins. Much easier than changing the walls after they’re built!


### 3. 🧩 Improves Team Communication and Planning

Clear requirements mean that everyone—developers, designers, testers, and clients—understands what needs to be done. This reduces confusion, helps assign tasks, and leads to smoother teamwork.

> **Good communication = fewer mistakes and delays.**

> In summary, Requirement Analysis is like the foundation of a building. A strong foundation leads to a strong product.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is not a single step—it involves several important activities that help teams understand what the software should do.

Here are the **five key activities** involved:

### • 📥 Requirement Gathering  
Collecting raw information from users, stakeholders, or clients about what they expect from the system.

- This step is like asking, “What do you need?”
- It may involve interviews, surveys, observations, or reviewing existing systems.


### • 🎙️ Requirement Elicitation  
Digging deeper to uncover the real needs behind what users say.

- Sometimes, people don’t know exactly what they want or need.
- This activity involves asking detailed questions, analyzing workflows, and identifying hidden needs.


### • 📝 Requirement Documentation  
Writing down all the collected requirements clearly and accurately.

- This creates a shared reference for both technical and non-technical team members.
- Common formats: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, or requirement tables.


### • 📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling  
Organizing and analyzing the requirements to understand their meaning and relationships.

- Helps remove duplicates, spot conflicts, and prioritize features.
- Diagrams like flowcharts, use-case diagrams, or wireframes can help visualize the system.


### • ✅ Requirement Validation  
Checking that the documented requirements are complete, correct, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

- Ensures that nothing important is missed.
- May involve walkthroughs, reviews, and feedback sessions.


> These activities work together to ensure the software meets real user needs and is built correctly fr

## 📋 Types of Requirements

Based on the provided website the system's requirements are seperated as **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. These help the team build a reliable and user-friendly application.


### ✅ Functional Requirements

These are the features and actions the system should perform. In simple terms, they describe **what the system does**.

Here are examples from the booking platform:

- **Hotel Listing Management:** Hotel managers must be able to add, edit, or remove their hotel listings.
- **Search Functionality:** Users should be able to search for hotels based on location, availability, and price range.
- **Booking:** Users should be able to book a hotel and receive booking confirmation.
- **Payment Integration:** The system must support secure payment through third-party services.
- **User Profiles:** Both customers and hotel managers should have their own user accounts and dashboards.
- **View Bookings:** Users should be able to view current and past bookings.


### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

These describe **how** the system performs, rather than what it does. They focus on performance, reliability, and usability.

Here are examples for the booking app:

- **Scalability:** The system must handle thousands of users simultaneously without crashing.
- **Performance:** Hotel search results should appear in under 2 seconds using Elasticsearch.
- **Availability:** The platform should have 99.9% uptime, especially during high traffic periods.
- **Data Consistency:** Real-time syncing of booking data across services using Kafka messaging.
- **Security:** All user data and payments should be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability:** The system should follow a microservices architecture to allow easy updates and fixes.
- **Caching:** Redis should be used to cache recent data to reduce database load and speed up response time.


> Understanding both types of requirements ensures the software not only works correctly but also delivers a smooth and dependable experience for everyone involved.
